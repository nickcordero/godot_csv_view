# GapCreator


(GodotApplicationProject Creator)
Cross platform app creation using Godot

This project has two goals:
1. GapCreator aims to allow developers that want to utilize Godot's amazing one click cross platform technology with application creation.
2. To provide users access to any part of the project that will help theirs. (example: Widgets created for GapCreator)

Here is a summary of Godot as it stands by itself:

Programs made with Godot:

For application development, Godot already offers a fair amount of built in widgets along with RAD with WYSIWYG. A community push to turn this software in to a complete software development platform (Game Development and Application Development) could be that missing piece of the puzzle that has always been so elusive for bringing application development to the masses in the same way winforms and vb6 did before. Imagine that type of freedom for all users -- not locked down to one single proprietary OS and available to all.

Godot alleviates most of these drawbacks and should present itself as not only a fantastic game development package, but a complete software development package. It would be great to attract more developers that are interested in toolkit and application development to the project to solidify a complete development solution.

There are many widget toolkits and application frameworks. Unfortunately many of these have substantial shortcomings or are not user friendly for users that are not seasoned developers.

(this list is extremely incomplete as far as toolkits and the pros and cons. It is meant to illustrate a point)

Electron - Easy to get an application up and running quickly
  Pro: Easy to get an application up and running quickly.
  Con: Memory inefficient. Projects have a massive amount of files. 
  
QT
  Pro: Cross platform, multiple language support, WYSIWYG form designer, RAD
  Con: Uses C++, licensing is confusing for new users.
  
Tk
  Pro: Uses Python(or many others) Easy to get a simple application designed and running. Can be developed in many IDEs and text editors.
  Con: Many do not like the out of date look. Difficult to get a complex application designed and running.

Winforms / WPF:
  Pro: WYSIWYG / RAD. Multiple language support. Easy deployment.
  Con: Windows only, requires .net

JavaFX:
  Pro: Cross platform. Has WYSIWYG capability. 
  Con: Very confusing development setup. Various versions leave new users baffled. Requires Java.

wxWidgets:
  Pro: Cross platform, has many bindings
  Con: Not new user friendly. Application deployment is confusing.
  
Haxe:
  Pro: Cross Platform
  Con: Widget toolkits are out of date/confusing or just utilize things like Electron.
  
Ruby Shoes:
  Pro: Uses ruby and is cross platform
  Con: require ruby, does not have WYSIWYG widget building.
  
Gtk+
  Pro: Open source, many bindings, corss platform. Glade for WYSIWYG
  Con: Cross platform deployment is difficult.
  
What does Godot offer for application development?

- Easy to get an application up and running quickly
- Cross platform
- Super easy to get a development environment up and running quickly, cross platform IDE.
- Easy building and export to all major platforms
- WYSIWYG
- RAD
- Multiple language support with better support in the works
- Open source with an amazing license - not locked down to a SaaS model or a major corporation.
- Godot's game engine allows for applications to incorporate beautiful and interactive media.
- Godot isn't missing much for being able to create many types of applications. There are some shortcomings though. A good example of this is there isnt a datagrid view that is easy to work with. Filling in these gaps can bring Godot that much closer to being an all in one development solution.
